# Capture The Scene

I used video frames to create a panoramic image using OpenCV library. Frames are extracted at intervals to ensure sufficient overlap, then stitched together using feature detection and matching. The stitching algorithm aligns overlapping regions, computes transformations, and blends frames into a seamless panorama. Key optimizations include reducing frame skipping, resizing output for the desired resolution and leveraging panorama-specific stitching mode for robust alignment and minimal artifacts.
